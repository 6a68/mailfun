## mailfun: the hacker's mail platform

what the fuck? dreaming out loud, that's what.

1. read [this](http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/Bruce_Sterling/comp_game_designers.article
) three times and meditate on it.
2. not a workflow, an engine for building workflows. not a spam filter, a hackable medium to insert your own (or somebody else's) spam filter. not an IMAP server, a pluggable message broker that does whatever you want, and syncs however you want, or not at all.
3. but of course, if you just want to use, and not create: a good Jeep, old-skool Jeep, for getting shit done without getting in the way. and, an engine for building+selling Jeeps.




Haven't you ever wanted to take that mail stream and hack on it?

Here's a totally customizable mail experience for you to enjoy.

Everything from input stream to final display layout is hackable and modular. Build your own spam filter. Selectively forward messages to your cell phone, or to a service that'll call you and read you your mail. Whatever. It is yours. The front-end is just a JSON API and optional long-poll for notifications.

The goal: to build a hacker's delight of a mail platform.
