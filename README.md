## mailfun: the hacker's mail platform

Haven't you ever wanted to take that mail stream and hack on it?

Here's a totally customizable mail experience for you to enjoy.

Everything from input stream to final display layout is hackable and modular. Build your own spam filter. Selectively forward messages to your cell phone, or to a service that'll call you and read you your mail. Whatever. It is yours. The front-end is just a JSON API and optional long-poll for notifications.

The goal: to build a hacker's delight of a mail platform.
